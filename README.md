## Data Structures

This section provides implementations of various data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. Each data structure is organized in its own module, with a detailed explanation of its functionality, usage, and time complexity analysis.

The following data structures are currently available:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Table (Dictionary)
- Set
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Graph
- Trie
- and more...

Feel free to explore the individual modules to understand the implementation details and usage examples.

## Algorithms

This section provides implementations of essential algorithms used in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. These algorithms are organized into different categories, such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

The following algorithm categories are currently available:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- and more...

Each algorithm module includes a detailed explanation, step-by-step algorithm description, and time complexity analysis.
